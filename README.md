Front-end Web Developer with experience as a salesman and electronic technician. I bring forth a unique skill in creating a user experience and customer services. Recently earned a certificate in Full Stack Development from the University of Utah professional education, with newly developed skills in JavaScript, CSS, React.js, and responsive web design. My aim in any development project is to innovate and develop apps that have a impactful user-experience. For example in my recent project where I worked in a team of four to develop a full stack MERN app that was called Sugar Pin. Sugar Pin app help people keep track there diabetic number and helps them to know if they need to raise or lower their blood sugar levels. Iâ€™m excited to use my skill in the future as part of a quality-driven team to build better experiences on the web.
